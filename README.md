the first job that landing page do is create the navbar dynamically based on the sections of the web page it check how many section is exist in the page and create a link for each section in the navbar and an event listener on each link to Scroll Smoothly to it's section.

The Navbar is linked with the section so when you scroll the landing page the navbar active link changed based on the current section in the viewport and the section and link both will have a special styling to look differant from the other.
